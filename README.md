# CEH Practical & Exam Notes 

This repository contains my personal notes and hands-on practice materials while preparing for the **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)** exam. I’ve included summaries of key topics as well as step-by-step lab exercises using common cybersecurity tools.

##  What's Inside

-  `Theory-Notes/` – Simplified notes covering important CEH concepts like scanning, enumeration, malware, etc.
-  `Practical-Labs/` – Lab exercises I’ve worked on using tools such as Nmap, Metasploit, and Wireshark.
-  `Cheatsheets/` – Quick reference guides for commands and tool usage.
-  `Tools/` – Custom scripts and notes on tools I found useful during practice.
