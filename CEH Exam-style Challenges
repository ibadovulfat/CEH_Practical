## ðŸ§ª Practice-Style Questions for CEH Practical Preparation

Here are 20 types of questions that are likely to appear in the CEH Practical exam, based on common patterns, topics, and hands-on lab skills:

1. Scan a given subnet and identify which host is running an outdated web server. Provide the version number.
2. Enumerate open SMB ports on a Windows target and extract the NetBIOS hostname and domain.
3. Find the number of Mercury services running on a server by performing targeted port scanning.
4. Identify a host with RDP enabled and perform a brute-force attack on it to retrieve the correct credentials.
5. Access an Android device via ADB, locate a specific image file, and extract hidden data using steganography.
6. Calculate the CRC32 checksum of a given file and submit the result.
7. Use OpenVAS or a similar scanner to identify vulnerabilities and report the CVE with the lowest severity.
8. Extract a hidden password from an image file using `steghide` with a known passphrase.
9. Perform SQL injection on a given web application and extract user credentials from the database.
10. Crack a password hash stored in a `.txt` file using `john` and a known wordlist.
11. Connect to an SMB share with discovered credentials and read a specific file from the share.

14. Analyze a pcap file using Wireshark and determine which host sent the least number of packets to a specific destination.
15. Use a Remote Access Tool (RAT) interface to remotely access a target folder and count the number of files stored inside.
16. Examine a PE (Portable Executable) file using a tool like Detect-It-Easy (DIE) and extract the virtual memory address from the ELF header.
17. Decrypt a VeraCrypt container using a password retrieved from a cracked hash and access its hidden file.
18. Access the DVWA application hosted on a web server and decode a base64-encoded message from the uploaded files.
19. Use Aircrack-ng with a captured .cap file to recover a WPA password and provide the number of characters in the password.
20. Investigate an IoT packet capture file and identify the MQTT topic length from a Publish message.
