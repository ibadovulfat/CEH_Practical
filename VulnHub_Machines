## üß± Recommended VulnHub Machines for CEH Practical 

These machines were selected based on the topics and tools covered in the latest CEH Practical scenarios:

### üî∞ Beginner-Friendly Labs

- **Mr. Robot (v1)**  
  Based on the popular TV series. Combines enumeration, WordPress exploitation, and privilege escalation. Great for learning web+Linux basics.

- **Basic Pentesting 1**  
  Simple Linux box for practicing SSH, RDP brute force, and privilege escalation. Mimics several exam-style questions.

- **Metasploitable 2**  
  Contains dozens of vulnerable services for testing tools like Nmap, Hydra, SMB, FTP, and Metasploit. Essential for lab familiarity.

- **Kioptrix Series (1‚Äì5)**  
  Classic boxes that cover a wide range of topics from service enumeration to kernel exploits. Good escalation practice.

### üß™ Intermediate Level Machines

- **DC Series (DC-1 to DC-5)**  
  Perfect for Active Directory practice. Includes SMB enumeration, password attacks, and privilege escalation.

- **Bulldog 1.0**  
  Mimics a real Windows environment. Useful for testing RDP login, password cracking, and lateral movement.

- **FristiLeaks 1.3**  
  Web-based challenges (LFI, weak credentials, steg) with a focus on layered access control and hidden data.

- **Symfonos Series**  
  Focuses on Linux privilege escalation, local enumeration, and service misconfigurations.

- **VulnOS 2**  
  Includes vulnerable services, SQL injection, file upload issues, and privilege escalation.

### üîí Advanced & Specialized Machines

- **Jefferson**  
  Complex chain of exploits, including steganography, FTP issues, and tricky privilege escalation. Time-consuming but rewarding.

- **SkyTower**  
  Emulates a multi-layer enterprise setup: combines web, database, network misconfigs, and Windows auth.

- **SickOS 1.2**  
  Great for learning manual SQLi, reverse shell crafting, and privilege escalation via cron jobs.

- **PwnLab: Init**  
  Simulates file upload vulnerabilities, SQLi, and Apache misconfigurations. Solid for CVE hunting with Metasploit.

- **Raven 1 & 2**  
  OSINT + WordPress + database injection + weak creds. Mimics exam-style multi-stage exploitation.

- **HA: Infinity Stones**  
  Themed box with multiple entry points, suitable for chaining attacks and simulating exam environments.

- **Brainpan 1**  
  Simple binary exploitation and reverse engineering ‚Äî good prep for buffer overflow-style thinking.

- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)**  
  **CEH Domain:** Web Application Security & Exploitation  
  **Why:** Practice SQL injection, XSS, command injection, file inclusion, and other web vulnerabilities in a safe lab environment.

### ‚úÖ Why these machines?

These VMs map directly to tasks found in CEH Practical like:
- SMB and RDP brute-forcing (Hydra, smbclient, nmap -p 139/445/3389)
- Android access via ADB (`adb shell`, `adb pull`, `Phonesploit`)
- Steganography tools like **Steghide**, **OpenStego**, and **Stegsnow**
- Hash cracking with **John the Ripper**, **Hashcat**, **CrackStation**, **Hashes.com**
- Web exploitation with **sqlmap**, **Burp Suite**, and **ZAP**
- Malware detection using **DIE** and PE file analysis
- Veracrypt volume cracking and mounting after password discovery
- Network traffic analysis using **Wireshark** and pcap file filtering

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Tips
- Import VMs in **VirtualBox** or **VMware**.
- Run alongside **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS** attacker machine.
- Create snapshots to restore after each lab.
- Always document:
  - IPs
  - Discovered usernames/passwords
  - Exploited services and CVEs
  - Escalation paths
